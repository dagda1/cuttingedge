# Current Contract Strategy

## Situation

- Contract runs until October 2025
- Need the income, can't leave early
- Team doesn't care about code quality
- AI-generated duplication everywhere, no appetite to fix it
- Fighting it is a losing battle
- Affecting mental health

## The Reframe

This is a paid lab experiment. Front row seat to what happens when teams go all-in on AI without guardrails.

## Strategy

### Disengage Emotionally

- Stop caring about their codebase more than they do
- Their mess is not your mess
- You're a mercenary, not a missionary
- Do the job, get paid, save energy for what comes next

### Observe Clinically

- Document what you see (dates, patterns, examples)
- Note when problems start surfacing
- Watch how leadership responds when velocity drops
- See what eventually breaks and how
- This becomes your case study (even if you can't name them)

### Use the Time

- 9 months to build the escape route
- Network reactivation (5 messages this week)
- Blog posts (AI duplication post ready)
- Website positioning updated
- Build runway for October

## What to Document

- Duplication patterns (how many, how fast)
- When edge cases start breaking things
- Team response when bugs appear
- Leadership response when velocity drops
- Any "we need to rebuild" conversations
- Timeline from "AI is amazing" to "why is everything slow"

## Possible Outcomes

1. **They ask you to fix it** - You're already there, you understand the mess, you become the solution
2. **You leave in October with experience** - Full arc observed, credibility for future work
3. **Contract ends early** - Fine, you've been building the next thing anyway

## Mental Health Protection

- This is a job, not your identity
- Lower your investment
- Don't fight battles they don't want won
- Keep a clear boundary between work and self
- The frustration is valid, but dwelling on it costs you
