# Data Insight Service

## The Idea

Help businesses make sense of their scattered data. Not ETL, not dashboards—insight.

## What AI Can't Do Here

- Pull from multiple sources over time
- Know what "wrong" looks like for this specific business
- Spot the fat-fingered CRM entry
- Know which metrics actually matter
- Remember context from yesterday
- Own the outcome

## The Gap

Tools move data. They don't know what matters.

Business owners don't want to learn Fivetran. They want someone to say "here's what's actually happening in your business."

## The Offer (Draft)

"I pull your data from the places it's scattered, clean up the mess, and give you something you can actually make decisions from."

## Why This Fits

- Uses technical skill but isn't code
- Can't be done in one prompt
- Requires judgment and persistence
- The value is the answer, not the plumbing
- Something I'd actually enjoy

## Who Buys This

- Business owners drowning in data across spreadsheets, CRMs, ad platforms, accounting software
- People who know the answers are in there but can't get to them
- Not technical, don't want to be

## To Test

- Find one business owner (even tangentially known)
- Offer to look at their data mess for free
- See what I find, see if it's valuable, see if I enjoy it

## Open Questions

- What does pricing look like?
- Retainer vs project?
- How to find these people?
- What tools to use?
