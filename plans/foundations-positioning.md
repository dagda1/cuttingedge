# Foundations Positioning

## The Problem

You get hired to set up good foundations - architecture, CI/CD, testing, structure. Once it's done, they need you less. Valuable work, but a tough business model.

## The Positioning

"I set up the foundations that let your team (or AI) move fast without breaking things."

AI can write code. Junior devs can write code. But someone needs to set up the architecture that stops it all becoming a mess.

## What AI Can't Replace

- **Ownership** - Accountable when it goes wrong, reputation on the line
- **Continuity** - Knows why decisions were made, won't hallucinate the codebase
- **Judgment** - Knows what not to build, pushes back on bad ideas
- **Trust** - Contracts, liability, a human relationship

## Framing

| Instead of...           | Try...                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| "I'm a developer"       | "I own your technical problems"                   |
| "I build software"      | "I make sure it actually works and keeps working" |
| "1 person team"         | "Senior technical partner without the overhead"   |
| "I use AI to be faster" | "You get senior judgment at startup speed"        |

## Business Model Options

1. **Project model** - Fixed-price engagements. In, out, next client. Needs steady pipeline.
2. **Retainer** - Set it up, then 4 hours/month to review PRs, advise, protect what you built.
3. **Target repeatable stage** - Seed startups hiring first devs, agencies spinning up projects. Same problem, different client.
4. **Productise** - Starter templates, architecture docs, CI configs. Sell the setup as a package.

## Challenge

Marketing this is hard. Needs further exploration in separate context.

## Target Clients

- Companies about to scale their dev team
- Agencies starting new client projects
- Startups who've been hacking and now need structure
- Teams adopting AI tools who need guardrails
