# Market Validation: Week 1

## Goal

Test whether your existing network can surface opportunities - either for "AI codebase cleanup" work or general foundations/architecture projects.

## What We Learned

- Public channels (LinkedIn, Twitter) are full of consultants selling, not buyers asking
- Decision-makers with real problems don't post publicly - they ask their network privately
- Performance consulting market is congested with SEO-savvy competitors
- Your actual differentiator (judgment, foundations, robust code) is hard to market publicly
- Your network from 25 years is the real asset

## Performance Consulting

**Status:** On hold

**Reason:** Market is congested, discovery channels are owned by entrenched players, and the positioning doesn't match what clients actually valued about your work.

**Not abandoned:** Performance knowledge folds into a bigger offering - it's part of the toolkit, not the headline.

## New Focus: Network Activation

### This Week: 5 Reconnection Messages

- [ ] Identify 5 former clients/colleagues now in senior roles (can hire or refer)
- [ ] Send message to person 1
- [ ] Send message to person 2
- [ ] Send message to person 3
- [ ] Send message to person 4
- [ ] Send message to person 5

### Message Template

Keep it simple, no pitch:

> Hey [name], hope things are going well at [company]. I'm exploring some new directions and trying to understand what problems people are dealing with right now - especially around codebases getting messy as teams scale or adopt AI tools. Would be curious to hear what you're seeing, no agenda.

### What You're Looking For

- What problems are they actually facing?
- Any mention of: scaling issues, technical debt, AI-generated code problems, team velocity, messy codebases
- Openings for "funny you mention that, we're dealing with..."

## Emerging Opportunity: AI Cleanup Wave

Companies that went hard on AI-generated code in 2024-2025 may be hitting the wall - can't maintain it, can't scale it, can't onboard new devs.

**Too early to validate publicly** - but your network conversations might surface this.

## Findings

### Network Conversations

| Name | Company | What they said | Follow-up? |
| ---- | ------- | -------------- | ---------- |
|      |         |                |            |
|      |         |                |            |
|      |         |                |            |
|      |         |                |            |
|      |         |                |            |

### Patterns

(add notes here as you have conversations)

## Next Steps

After 5 conversations, assess:

- [ ] Did anyone have a problem you could help with?
- [ ] What problems came up most?
- [ ] Any warm leads worth pursuing?
- [ ] Does "AI codebase cleanup" resonate or is it too early?
