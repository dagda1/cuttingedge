## Does your development team lack frontend experience?
Good quality frontend developers are hard to come by, and hiring is no guarantee of success.

## Imagine your team had the perfect frontend environment to deliver features faster with fewer bugs. 
Imagine frontend industry experts armed your team with the knowledge to develop frontend features that perform better, have fewer defects and have higher quality HTML and CSS.

Imagine you no longer need to hire new and expensive frontend developers.

Imagine there is no risk in frontend development.


## Get a frontend productivity roadmap from industry experts
Let us set your team up to deliver frontend features in hours rather than days.  Remove all the hidden friction that harms your team's ability to provide features faster with fewer bugs that adhere to industry standards.

We have been in the frontend space for 20+ years and have over <MyPullRequests /> into many public open-source repositories.

## Here is how it works
We start with an initial project kickoff session where you tell us about the problems you are currently facing, and we set the goals or outcomes for the engagement.

We focus on the following five key areas that can grind development teams to a halt:

- Communication
- Development
- Bug tracking and resolution
- Testing (manual, unit testing and e2e testing)
- Build and deployment

## What you get (deliverables)
- An audit of your team's current practices based on the five key areas listed above.
- A playback of our findings and the specific areas where we can boost productivity.
- An agreement with the team of where we can implement the changes and in what order they should happen.
- A detailed productivity roadmap and an itemised checklist to monitor progress.  

You can get a feel for what we look for and some great solutions to common problems by trying our [mini frontend productivity healthcheck](/productivity-test/1).

## What we require from you
- A walkthrough of how new work is defined with some examples of any tickets or artefacts, e.g. spring planning., new ticket creation.
- A walkthrough with a lead developer of one or more repositories to understand current tooling and practices.
- A walkthrough of the current build and continuous integration pipeline
- A walkthrough of how defects are tracked
