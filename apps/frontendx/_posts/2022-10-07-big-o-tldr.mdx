Big O is a notation used to describe the computational complexity of an algorithm.  The computational algorithm is split into two parts:

- Time complexity or the amount of time required to run the algorithm relative to the input size
- Space complexity of how much memory is allocated by the algorithm relative to the input size

## constant time
The best complexity is $$O(1)$$ called `constant time` or `constant space`, meaning that the algorithm always uses the same amount of resources regardless of the input.

## Time complexity

### $$O(n)$$ complexity
```ts
for (const n of arr) {
  console.log(n);
}
```
This algorithm has a time complexity of $$O(n)$$.  Each loop of the iteration costs $$O(1)$$.

### $$O(n^2)$$ complexity
```ts
for (const n of arr) {
  for (const n2 of arr) {
    console.log(n & n2);
  }
}
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of $$(On^2)$$:

- outer loop costs $$O(n)$$
- inner loop costs $$O(n)$$
---------------------------
- $$O(n.n) = O(n^2)$$
---------------------------

### $$O(n + m)$$ complexity

```ts
for (const n of arr) {
  console.log(n);
}

for (const n of arr) {
  console.log(n);
}

for (const m of arr2) {
  console.log(m);
}
```

- first loop costs $$O(n)$$
- second loop costs $$O(n)$$
- the third loop costs $$O(m)$$
---------------------------
- $$O(2n + m)$$ which in big O notation is $$0(n + m)$$ because the constant is ignored.
---------------------------
