# Market Validation Plan – Shopify Performance

## Goal

Validate which Shopify performance problem people will pay to fix before investing more time or code.

## Step 1: Pick 3 candidate problems

- Paid-traffic waste: slow mobile product pages or add-to-cart lag wasting ad spend
- App/script bloat: too many third-party apps/scripts slowing the site
- SEO revenue loss: technical SEO issues blocking traffic (indexing, duplication, metadata)

## Step 2: Outreach test

- Send 10 messages per problem (30 total)
- Each message includes:
  - One specific issue you observed
  - Why it costs money
  - One CTA: “15-minute call?”
- No pitching. No reports. Just validation.

## Step 3: Decision rule

- The problem with the most replies/calls booked wins
- If none get replies: message or targeting is wrong, not the market

## Rule

Do not build more tooling until you get 1–3 paid conversations
