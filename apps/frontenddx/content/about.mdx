## [Paul Cowan (CEO)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-cowan-19bb1116/)

My passion is and always has been frontend development. I love the instant visual feedback that is unique to frontend development.
          
I am an open-source fanatic with over <MyPullRequests /> into many, many, many open source repositories.

I write professionally for [logrocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/paulcowan/) and my own [personal blog](https://thesoftwaresimpleton.com).

I have over 20 years of experience working on some exceptional frontend pieces of work for companies such as [waitrose](https://waitrose.com), [the Volvo ocean race](https://www.volvogroup.com/en/about-us/history-and-r-d-milestones/volvo-ocean-race.html), the Scottish and Northern Irish governments and many others.
          
I put a lot of my success as a frontend developer down to my ability to construct the best frontend development environment to allow development teams to flourish.
