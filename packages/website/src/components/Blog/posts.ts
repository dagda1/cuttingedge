    title: 'SVG transformations with affine matrices',
    summary:
      'I recently had a requirement to add zooming and panning to an svg image. Panning and zooming are popular interaction techniques which let the user focus on a region of interest by restricting the view. The obvious choice was to use d3-zoom but as react is rendering the svg content, D3 is a bit of a bad fit as it mutates the DOM directly. I somehow ended up using affine matrices to compute the transformations.',

    title: 'Creating an Accessible React Website',
    summary:
      "I've recently been working on an online application form in the form of a multistep wizard that had strict accessibility requirements. I've never worked on a project with such strict requirements before. I've also heard rumblings that it was not possible to make a SPA accessible. It turns out that there is not that much work involved in making your site accessible and I am going to ensure that any work I do from now on has an accessible first approach. I'm now going to outline in no particular order what I have learned over the past few months.",

    summary:
      'I have spent the last year learning some of the maths I should have learned about 27 years ago. One of the things that I have found interesting while learning maths is the relationship between the unit circle and a sine wave graph of y = sin(x).',
