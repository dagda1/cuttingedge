/**
 * Block and wait for all of the given operations to complete. Returns an array of
 * values that the given operations evaluated to. This has the same purpose as
 * [Promise.all](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all).
 *
 * If any of the operations become errored, then `all` will also become errored.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { main, all, fetch } from 'effection';
 *
 * main(function*() {
 *  let [google, bing] = yield all([fetch('http://google.com').text(), fetch('http://bing.com').text()]);
 *  // ...
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @typeParam T the type of the array of options, this can a heterogenous array
 * @param operations a list of operations to wait for
 * @returns the list of values that the operations evaluate to, in the order they were given
